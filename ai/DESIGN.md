## ðŸŽ¨ Design Guidelines

### Design Philosophy
The website follows a clean, minimal, and academic design, prioritizing readability and ease of navigation. The layout is content-focused, with minimal distractions and a professional appearance suitable for a personal academic/professional site.

### Layout Structure
- The main layout is defined in `_layouts/mylayout.html`.
- The layout includes a header (site title), navigation bar, main content section, and footer.
- Navigation is dynamically generated from site pages with a `navigation_weight` property.

### Color Palette & Typography
- **Primary color:** #00827F (used for links and highlights)
- **Text color:** #222 (main text), #828282 (icons)
- **Font:** 'Open Sans', 'Noto Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif for body; 'Quicksand' for headers.

### Responsive Design
- The site is mobile-friendly, with navigation adapting for screens under 300px wide.
- Layout uses a centered wrapper with a max-width of 700px for readability.

### Assets
- Images and icons are stored in the `assets/` directory.
- Main images: `me2021.jpg`, `me2014.jpg`, `me2018.jpg`, `me2010.jpg`, `bi.png`.

### CSS/SCSS
- Main stylesheet: `assets/css/style.scss`.
- Styles are modular and follow a simple, maintainable structure.
- Uses SCSS for maintainability and potential theming.

### Assets

- `bi.png`: personal icon (do not use)
- `me2021.jpg`: personal photo (the other files me*.jpg are older pictures, do not use them)
- `logo.svg`: main logo of the website
