### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity
- **Limit each file to 500 lines.** If you approach this limit, refactor by splitting into modules or helper files.
- **Group code by feature or responsibility**, keeping modules self-contained.
- **Use clear, consistent imports**, preferring relative imports within the same package.

### 📎 Style & Conventions
- **Language**: The content of the website must be in English.
- **Don't use inline CSS**: use the style.css file for all the css do not inline it.
- **Layout**: the main layout of the site is in _layouts/mylayout.html
- **Programming Language**: Jekyll for github-pages with html and markdown.
- **Naming & Formatting**: Follow standard conventions .
- **Documentation**:  
  - Avoid excessive inline comments; reserve them for non-obvious logic.

### 📚 Documentation & Clarity
- **Comment only non-obvious code** to aid a mid-level developer’s understanding.
- For complex algorithms, add a brief inline note explaining *why*, not just *what*.
